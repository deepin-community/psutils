The original upstream distribution includes two files of questionable
copyright: md68_0.ps and md71_0.ps.  These files have been removed
from the distribution along with things that depend on them.  The
following exact steps were taken:

rm md68_0.ps md71_0.ps fixmacps.man fixmacps.pl

Changes to the Makefile to avoid installing these files are made with
a patch.
